# ASP0016: Do not return a value from RequestDelegate

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |ASP0016|
| **Category** |Usage|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A method used to create a `RequestDelegate` returns `Task<T>`. `RequestDelegate` discards this value.

## Rule description

Do not return a value from `RequestDelegate`.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the return type to non-generic `Task` or, if the delegate is a route handler, cast it to `Delegate` so the return value is written to the response.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.
